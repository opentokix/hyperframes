# HyperFrames Capability Showcase — Example Library

**Purpose:** Every HyperFrames technique demonstrated in one place, scene by scene. Read this when planning a video — pick the techniques you'll use, then study their scenes BEFORE writing any composition.

**Why this library exists:** Across 11 isolated pipeline-evaluation runs, ZERO agents used HyperFrames' powerful capabilities — they all defaulted to screenshot + Ken Burns + voiceover. Skill prose can't fix that. Worked examples can. Every scene in this library is 100% composed from divs/SVG/CSS/GSAP — no captured screenshots, no slideshow tricks.

## How to use this library

**When planning a beat:**

1. Open this file. Find the section that matches the technique you want.
2. Open the section's `README.md`. Read 1-line summary of each scene.
3. Open at least 2 scene HTML files. Read the full source — markup, GSAP timeline, easings, comments.
4. Copy the closest scene into your `compositions/` directory. Rename. Mutate the content. Preserve the timeline structure and event density.

**When stuck on motion that feels static or boring:**

- Look at section `12-combined-vignettes/` — these are full multi-technique scenes. The chat scene (`04-composed-ui/scene-02-chat-with-typing.html`) is the gold standard for narration-synced events.
- Look at section `13-anti-patterns/` — the bad examples. Make sure your scene doesn't match any of these.

## Shared assets

- [`_shared/hyper-shader-local.js`](_shared/hyper-shader-local.js) — local shader build (copied from `packages/shader-transitions/dist/index.global.js`). Scenes in `05-transitions-shader/` and `12-combined-vignettes/` import this.
- [`_shared/shared-styles.css`](_shared/shared-styles.css) — design tokens (color palette, type scale, spacing). Every scene `<link>`s this so the catalog feels cohesive.
- [`_shared/easing-glossary.md`](_shared/easing-glossary.md) — the 7 production easings and when to use each. Single source of truth.

## Stitched reels

The `_stitched/` directory contains 2-3 long videos that play many scenes in sequence — useful for visual-gestalt review:

- [`_stitched/grand-tour.html`](_stitched/grand-tour.html) — every section, end to end (~15-25 min rendered)
- [`_stitched/motion-and-text.html`](_stitched/motion-and-text.html) — sections 1-3 + 12 highlights (kinetic typography reel)
- [`_stitched/ui-and-effects.html`](_stitched/ui-and-effects.html) — sections 4-7 + 10-11 highlights (composed UI + VFX reel)

Rendered MP4s live in `_stitched/renders/` and are mirrored on HeyGen Verse for browser viewing.

## Authoring conventions (read before adding a scene)

Every scene in this library follows these rules. They exist so agents reading the library see consistent patterns, not random codebases.

1. **Single HTML file**, structure exactly:
   ```html
   <template>
     <style>/* scoped to this scene */</style>
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="../_shared/shared-styles.css">
     <div id="<scene-id>"
          data-composition-id="<scene-id>"
          data-width="1920"
          data-height="1080"
          class="scene"
          style="background: var(--bg-deep);">
       <!-- scene markup -->
       <div class="scene-label">
         Section <NN> · <Scene name> · <Technique>
       </div>
     </div>
     <script>
       (function () {
         var BEAT = <duration-in-seconds>;
         window.__timelines = window.__timelines || {};
         var tl = gsap.timeline({ paused: true });
         // ... build timeline
         window.__timelines["<scene-id>"] = tl;
       })();
     </script>
   </template>
   ```

2. **`data-composition-id` matches the filename** (without `.html`). e.g. file `scene-01-soft-blur-in.html` → id `scene-01-soft-blur-in`.

3. **`.scene-label`** at bottom-left of every scene shows what technique is being demonstrated. Lets viewers of the stitched reel know what they're looking at without playing detective.

4. **`tl.fromTo()` not `tl.from()`** for entrances. Avoids the "CSS opacity:0 + gsap.from(opacity:0)" 0→0 trap.

5. **Continuous motion** — no element stays unchanged for more than ~1.5s. If a beat is 8s, schedule 5-8 events spread across the duration, not 5 events crammed into the first second.

6. **Easing variety** — minimum 3 different easings per scene. See `_shared/easing-glossary.md`.

7. **Determinism** — no `Math.random()`, `Date.now()`, `requestAnimationFrame`, or `repeat: -1`. Seed any "random" particles via a fixed array of values.

8. **Lint clean** — every scene must pass `npx hyperframes lint .` with 0 errors before being committed.

9. **Snapshot verified** — every scene's 5-frame snapshot must show CHANGE between frames (not entrance + 4 identical hold frames).

10. **Comments** — one comment per timeline section explaining WHY that timing was picked. Not WHAT it does (the code shows that). e.g. `// 1.2s: settle with elastic — gives the counter time to "land" before the next stat enters`.
