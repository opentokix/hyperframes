# HyperFrames Capability Showcase — Example Library

**Purpose:** Every HyperFrames technique demonstrated in one place, scene by scene. Read this when planning a video — pick the techniques you'll use, then study their scenes BEFORE writing any composition.

**Why this library exists:** Across 11 isolated pipeline-evaluation runs, ZERO agents used HyperFrames' powerful capabilities — they all defaulted to screenshot + Ken Burns + voiceover. Skill prose can't fix that. Worked examples can. Every scene in this library is 100% composed from divs/SVG/CSS/GSAP — no captured screenshots, no slideshow tricks.

---

## How to use this library

This library is a **reference frame**, not a template gallery. The website-to-hyperframes skill picks a mode per beat in step-3; honor that mode in step-5. The three modes:

| Mode             | When                                                                                                  | What you do                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **copy+mutate**  | A single scene is a near-1:1 fit (same UI shape, similar length, just different brand/content).       | Seed `compositions/beat-N-name.html` from the cited scene's `index.html`. Swap content + colors + copy + duration. Keep timeline + easings.|
| **recombine**    | No single scene fits, but 2-3 scenes each contribute a layer.                                          | Seed from the closest scene as structural base, then port patterns (counter logic, marker overlay, transition shape) from the others.       |
| **fresh**        | The beat is novel; nothing close enough exists. Examples set the bar for taste.                       | Write from scratch. Use cited scenes as taste references for easing variety, continuous-motion practice, snapshot determinism.              |

**Non-negotiable in every mode:** customize for the actual beat. If your output would be recognizable as "scene-X with content swapped," you copied without thinking. Examples are NEVER the finished beat — same scaffold, different soul.

**Process per beat:**

1. Find your beat's technique below in the lookup table. Open that scene's `index.html` and read the full source — markup, GSAP timeline, easings, comments.
2. Pick the mode that fits your beat (decided in step-3-storyboard.md).
3. In copy+mutate / recombine: seed from the cited scene. In fresh: write from scratch using examples as taste reference. **Always** customize.
4. Lint, snapshot, verify the result.

**When stuck on motion that feels static or boring:**

- Look at section `12-combined-vignettes/` — full multi-technique scenes. `scene-03-product-launch-beat/` combines 6 techniques (stroke-draw logo + kinetic headline + counter + marker + particle burst + breathing) in one beat — the most realistic "what a polished beat looks like" reference.
- The chat scene ([`04-composed-ui/scene-02-chat-with-typing/`](04-composed-ui/scene-02-chat-with-typing/)) is the gold standard for narration-synced events.
- Look at section `13-anti-patterns/` — the bad examples. Make sure your scene doesn't match any of these.

## Shared assets

- [`_shared/hyper-shader-local.js`](_shared/hyper-shader-local.js) — local shader build (copied from `packages/shader-transitions/dist/index.global.js`). Scenes in `05-transitions-shader/` and `12-combined-vignettes/` import this.
- [`_shared/shared-styles.css`](_shared/shared-styles.css) — design tokens (color palette, type scale, spacing). Every scene `<link>`s this so the catalog feels cohesive.
- [`_shared/easing-glossary.md`](_shared/easing-glossary.md) — the 7 production easings and when to use each. Single source of truth.

## Stitched Grand Tour reel

All 81 scenes concatenated back-to-back as a single 9:22 MP4. Useful for visual-gestalt review or for sharing the library at a glance:

- **Grand Tour reel:** https://www.heygenverse.com/s/23b285ce-a09a-487a-94d7-53f0c2827f2d/raw
- **Browsable gallery (per-section grid, all 81 scenes as embedded videos):** https://www.heygenverse.com/a/1636f2fe-3ddc-4543-9a56-0d0b99538807

Rebuild the reel after adding scenes: `ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i /tmp/concat-list.txt -c copy out.mp4` where the concat list orders all scene MP4s in section sequence.

---

## Authoring conventions (read before adding a scene)

Every scene in this library follows these rules. They exist so agents reading the library see consistent patterns, not random codebases.

1. **Standalone HTML5 document** per scene at `<section>/scene-NN-name/index.html`. Each scene is independently renderable via `npx tsx packages/cli/src/cli.ts render <scene-dir>`. Skeleton:
   ```html
   <!doctype html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
     <meta charset="UTF-8" />
     <title>scene-NN-name</title>
     <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/gsap@3.14.2/dist/gsap.min.js"></script>
     <style>/* scoped to this scene */</style>
   </head>
   <body>
     <div id="scene-NN-name"
          data-composition-id="scene-NN-name"
          data-start="0"
          data-duration="<seconds>"
          data-width="1920"
          data-height="1080">
       <!-- scene markup -->
       <div class="scene-label">Section NN · &lt;Scene name&gt; · &lt;Technique&gt;</div>
     </div>
     <script>
       (function () {
         var BEAT = <duration-in-seconds>;
         window.__timelines = window.__timelines || {};
         var tl = gsap.timeline({ paused: true });
         // ... build timeline
         window.__timelines["scene-NN-name"] = tl;
       })();
     </script>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

2. **`data-composition-id` matches the directory name** (which matches the scene id). e.g. directory `scene-01-soft-blur-in/` → id `scene-01-soft-blur-in`.

3. **`.scene-label`** at bottom-left of every scene shows what technique is being demonstrated. Lets viewers of the stitched reel know what they're looking at without playing detective.

4. **`tl.fromTo()` not `tl.from()`** for entrances. Avoids the "CSS opacity:0 + gsap.from(opacity:0)" 0→0 trap.

5. **Continuous motion** — no element stays unchanged for more than ~1.5s. If a beat is 8s, schedule 5-8 events spread across the duration, not 5 events crammed into the first second.

6. **Easing variety** — minimum 3 different easings per scene. See `_shared/easing-glossary.md`.

7. **Determinism** — no `Math.random()`, `Date.now()`, `requestAnimationFrame`, or `repeat: -1`. Seed any "random" particles via a fixed array of values.

8. **Lint clean** — every scene must pass `npx hyperframes lint .` with 0 errors before being committed.

9. **Snapshot verified** — every scene's 5-frame snapshot must show CHANGE between frames (not entrance + 4 identical hold frames).

10. **Comments** — one comment per timeline section explaining WHY that timing was picked. Not WHAT it does (the code shows that). e.g. `// 1.2s: settle with elastic — gives the counter time to "land" before the next stat enters`.
